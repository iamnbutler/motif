# Gesso

> Gesso is an immediate-mode UI framework for Rust, focusing on 2D rendering with type-safe geometry primitives.

Gesso provides a foundation for building high-performance UI applications with idiomatic Rust patterns. It leverages glamour/glam for linear algebra with custom unit types for coordinate space safety.

## Core Concepts

- **Coordinate Spaces**: Type-safe distinction between LogicalPixels (DPI-independent) and DevicePixels (physical)
- **Layout Primitives**: Edges, Corners for padding/margin/border/radii
- **Glamour Integration**: Re-exports glamour's Unit trait for custom coordinate spaces

## Crates

- [gesso](crates/gesso/) - Main crate, re-exports gesso_core
- [gesso_core](crates/gesso_core/) - Core types including geometry module

## Documentation

- [Geometry Design](docs/plans/2026-02-11-geometry-module-design.md) - Architecture decisions for geometry module

## Key Files

- [geometry.rs](crates/gesso_core/src/geometry.rs) - Core geometry primitives (Point, Size, Rect, Vector, Edges, Corners, Axis, ScaleFactor)
