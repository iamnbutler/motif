App creates Adapter::with_event_loop_proxy at window init\n2. adapter.process_event() called before handling winit events\n3. After each frame, compare AccessTree to previous, send TreeUpdate if changed\n4. ActionHandler routes actions (click, focus) back to app state\n\nKey types needed:\n- AccessTree: container for AccessNodes, generates TreeUpdates\n- AccessNode: motif's accessibility primitive\n- FocusManager: tracks focused element, handles navigation"}}
