This caused:\n- Rust QuadInstance: 112 bytes\n- Metal QuadInstance: 128 bytes (due to float3 padding alignment)\n- 16 byte mismatch per instance, causing Metal to read wrong offsets\n\nFIX: Changed Metal shader from 'float3 _padding' to three separate 'float _pad1, _pad2, _pad3' fields. Individual floats have 4-byte alignment matching Rust."}}
